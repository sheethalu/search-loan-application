Errors
Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. Depending on the status code, the response body may be in JSON or plaintext.

Search API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request along with clear error messages. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted).
